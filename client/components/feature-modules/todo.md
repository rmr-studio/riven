## Workflows and Automations

### Functions

Functions would be a sub-system within the workflow/automation environment where you can define an entity that would be used as an input, and then define a series of steps/conditions, loops and integration actions to be ran against that particular entity. It could either return nothing, or return a formulated output, consisting of another entity, or a set of entities (that could then be used to run other functions)

Functions can be accessed from within a workflow, or can be manually invoked through the entity data view (ie. `Execute function`) that would all functions assigned to an entity type
