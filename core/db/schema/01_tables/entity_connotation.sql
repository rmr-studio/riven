-- ENTITY CONNOTATION TABLE
-- =====================================================
-- Stores per-entity polymorphic semantic snapshot (SENTIMENT, RELATIONAL,
-- STRUCTURAL metadata categories) captured at last enrichment time. One snapshot
-- per entity. System-managed: no soft-delete, no audit columns. The snapshot is
-- internally system-write-only and intentionally lives on a sibling table to
-- avoid polluting entities.audit fields when re-enrichment writes occur.
