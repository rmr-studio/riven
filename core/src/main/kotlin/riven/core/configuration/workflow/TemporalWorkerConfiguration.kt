/**
 * Spring configuration for Temporal workers.
 *
 * This configuration:
 * 1. Creates a WorkflowClient from existing WorkflowServiceStubs bean
 * 2. Creates a WorkerFactory
 * 3. Creates workers for multiple task queues (default, external-api, per-workspace)
 * 4. Registers workflow implementations (WorkflowOrchestrationServiceImpl)
 * 5. Registers activity implementations (WorkflowCoordinationService Spring bean)
 * 6. Starts the worker factory
 * 7. Provides graceful shutdown via @PreDestroy
 *
 * Queue naming convention:
 * - workflows.default: System/internal workflows (V1: all workspace workflows routed here)
 * - activities.external-api: External API activities (isolation for rate-limited APIs)
 * - workflow.workspace.{uuid}: Per-workspace queues (future: tenant isolation)
 *
 * V1 Approach: All workspaces use WORKFLOWS_DEFAULT_QUEUE for simplicity.
 * Future: Per-workspace queue registration when workspace capacity/isolation needed.
 *
 * @property workflowServiceStubs Existing bean from TemporalEngineConfiguration
 * @property activities Autowired Spring bean with injected dependencies
