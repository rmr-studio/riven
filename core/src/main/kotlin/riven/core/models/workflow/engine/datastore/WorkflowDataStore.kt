/**
 * Unified workflow state container.
 *
 * Created in Phase 7.2 to replace:
 * - WorkflowState.dataRegistry (orchestration data)
 * - WorkflowExecutionContext (execution metadata + data)
 *
 * All workflow data flows through this single datastore:
 * - Trigger context: Set once at workflow start
 * - Step outputs: Write-once per node, read by templates
 * - Variables: Last-write-wins for user variables
 * - Loop contexts: Per-loop iteration state
 *
 * Thread-safe via ConcurrentHashMap for parallel node execution.
 *
 * This class provides thread-safe access to trigger context, step outputs,
 * user variables, and loop contexts.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 *
 * All internal storage uses [ConcurrentHashMap] for fine-grained concurrency:
 * - **Steps:** Write-once per key, concurrent reads
 * - **Variables:** Last-write-wins semantics
 * - **Loops:** Branch-scoped, minimal contention
 * - **Trigger:** Write-once, then read-only (uses @Volatile)
 *
 * ## Write-Once Enforcement
 *
 * Step outputs and trigger context enforce write-once semantics:
 * - [setStepOutput] throws [IllegalStateException] if key already exists
 * - [setTrigger] throws [IllegalStateException] if trigger already set
 *
 * This ensures execution results are immutable once recorded, preventing
 * accidental overwrites in parallel execution scenarios.
 *
 * ## Data Flow
 *
 * 1. DataStore created with immutable [WorkflowMetadata]
 * 2. Trigger context set once at workflow start
 * 3. Each node execution writes to steps via coordinator
 * 4. Template resolution reads from steps, trigger, variables, loops
 *
 * @property metadata Immutable workflow-level context, accessible directly
