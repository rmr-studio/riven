/**
 * Pure state transition logic for workflow state machine.
 *
 * This object provides the `apply()` function that processes state events and produces
 * new WorkflowState instances. All transitions are pure (no side effects) and immutable.
 *
 * ## Usage Pattern
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * var state = WorkflowState(phase = WorkflowExecutionPhase.INITIALIZING)
 *
 * // Apply events to transition state
 * state = StateTransition.apply(state, NodesReady(setOf(node1, node2)))
 * state = StateTransition.apply(state, NodeCompleted(node1, outputData))
 * state = StateTransition.apply(state, AllNodesCompleted)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Design Principles
 *
 * - **Immutability**: All transitions return new WorkflowState instances
 * - **Pure functions**: No side effects, same input always produces same output
 * - **Validation**: Throws IllegalStateException for invalid transitions
 * - **No business logic**: Only state transitions (orchestration logic is in coordinator)
 *
 * ## State Machine Diagram
 *
 * ```
 *     INITIALIZING
 *          |
 *          | NodesReady
 *          v
 *   EXECUTING_NODES ←──────┐
 *          |                |
 *          | NodeCompleted  | NodesReady
 *          |                | (more nodes ready)
 *          └────────────────┘
 *          |
 *          | AllNodesCompleted
 *          v
 *     COMPLETED
 *
 *   Any state → FAILED (NodeFailed or WorkflowFailed)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Error Handling (Phase 5 v1)
 *
 * In the current implementation, any NodeFailed event transitions directly to FAILED state.
 * Phase 7 will enhance this with:
 * - Retry strategies
 * - Error recovery workflows
 * - Partial completion handling
 * - Compensation logic
