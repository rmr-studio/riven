/**
 * Result of the enriched text construction step in the embedding pipeline.
 *
 * Carries the text itself along with metadata about truncation and estimated
 * token count so that downstream activities (storeEmbedding) can persist
 * the truncated flag accurately rather than hardcoding false.
 *
 * Temporal-serializable: uses only primitive types for Jackson compatibility.
 *
 * [estimatedTokens] uses a simple char/4 approximation (~4 chars per token).
