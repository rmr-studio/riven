/**
 * Temporal workflow interface for executing an integration data sync.
 *
 * A single workflow instance handles one connection+model combination per sync run.
 * The deterministic workflow ID `sync-{connectionId}-{model}` ensures that duplicate
 * webhook deliveries from Nango do not result in concurrent sync executions.
 *
 * DETERMINISM RULES:
 * - All side effects (DB, HTTP, timestamps) go through activities
 * - Use Workflow.getLogger() for logging (not KLogger)
 * - Use Workflow.randomUUID() if random IDs needed
 *
 * @see IntegrationSyncWorkflowImpl
