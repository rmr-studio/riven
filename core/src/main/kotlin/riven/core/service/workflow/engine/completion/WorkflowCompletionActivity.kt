/**
 * Temporal activity interface for recording workflow completion status.
 *
 * This activity is called at the end of workflow execution to:
 * - Update WorkflowExecutionEntity with final status (COMPLETED/FAILED)
 * - Update or remove the queue item
 * - Persist error details for failed workflows
 *
 * Separating completion handling from the dispatcher ensures:
 * - Queue only manages dispatch (PENDING → CLAIMED → DISPATCHED)
 * - Temporal owns all execution retries
 * - Final status is recorded reliably via activity retry
 *
 * @see WorkflowCompletionActivityImpl

     * 1. Updates WorkflowExecutionEntity with status, completedAt, duration, error
     * 2. Updates queue item status (COMPLETED) or deletes it

     * - Retries on transient DB errors (connection issues, deadlocks)
     * - Max 3 attempts with exponential backoff
     * - Failure here doesn't affect workflow result (already determined)

     * @param status Final status (COMPLETED or FAILED)
