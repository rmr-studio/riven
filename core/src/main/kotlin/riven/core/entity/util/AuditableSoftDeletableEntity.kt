/**
 * Base entity for all soft-deletable entities.
 *
 * `@SQLRestriction("deleted = false")` automatically appends `AND deleted = false` to all
 * JPQL, derived, and Criteria queries on every inheriting entity. This means deleted rows
 * are invisible to standard repository methods including `findById`.
 *
 * To query deleted entities (e.g. for restoration), use a **native SQL query** —
 * `@SQLRestriction` does not apply to native queries:
 * ```
 * @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = :id AND deleted = true", nativeQuery = true)
 * fun findDeletedById(id: UUID): MyEntity?
 * ```
