# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** End-to-end workflow lifecycle: create graph → save → execute via Temporal → see results
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Entity Context Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 8 (Action Executors)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 4 in progress - Plan 04-01 complete (Entity CRUD executors)
Last activity: 2026-01-11 — Completed 04-01-PLAN.md (All 3 tasks)

Progress: ████████░░ 43.75% (3.5/8 phases complete - Phase 4 halfway)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4 (all fully complete)
- Average duration: ~81 minutes (1.35 hours)
- Total execution time: 5.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Expression System | 1 | 0.5h | 0.5h |
| 2 - Entity Context Integration | 1 | 3.67h | 3.67h |
| 3 - Temporal Workflow Engine | 1 | 0.28h | 0.28h |
| 4 - Action Executors | 1 (of 2) | 0.75h | 0.75h |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 4 plans: 01-01 (0.5h), 02-01 (3.67h), 03-01 (0.28h), 04-01 (0.75h)
- Trend: Consistent velocity after Phase 2 complexity spike
