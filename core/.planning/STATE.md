# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** End-to-end workflow lifecycle: create graph → save → execute via Temporal → see results
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Entity Context Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Temporal Workflow Engine)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase 3 partial - Temporal workflow infrastructure operational (Task 3 deferred)
Last activity: 2026-01-10 — Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (Tasks 1-2)

Progress: █████░░░░░ 37.5% (2.5/8 phases - Phase 3 partial completion)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3 (2.5 fully complete, 0.5 partial)
- Average duration: ~90 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Total execution time: 4.33 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Expression System | 1 | 0.5h | 0.5h |
| 2 - Entity Context Integration | 1 | 3.67h | 3.67h |
| 3 - Temporal Workflow Engine | 1 (partial) | 0.17h | 0.17h |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (0.5h), 02-01 (3.67h), 03-01 (0.17h - partial)
- Trend: Phase 3 was faster due to infrastructure focus, test deferred
