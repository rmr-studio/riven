# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** End-to-end workflow lifecycle: create graph → save → execute via Temporal → see results
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Action Executors (Complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 8 (Action Executors)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-10 — Completed 04-02-PLAN.md (All 3 tasks)

Progress: ████████░░░░░░░░ 50% (4/8 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5 (all fully complete)
- Average duration: ~64 minutes (1.07 hours)
- Total execution time: 5.33 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Expression System | 1 | 0.5h | 0.5h |
| 2 - Entity Context Integration | 1 | 3.67h | 3.67h |
| 3 - Temporal Workflow Engine | 1 | 0.28h | 0.28h |
| 4 - Action Executors | 2 | 0.88h | 0.44h |

**Recent Trend:**
