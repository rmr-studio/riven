# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** External data flows reliably into workspace entities — records are deduplicated, relationships are resolved, and connection health is visible.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schema and Persistence Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 4 (Sync Webhook and Temporal Sync Workflow)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (complete)
Status: Phase 03 execution complete — pending verification
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Phase 03 execution complete (plans 01 + 02)

Progress: [███████░░░] 75%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All phases: Temporal for sync orchestration — durable execution, built-in retry, visibility
- All phases: Unique index on entities instead of mapping table (source_external_id + source_integration_id)
- Phase 3+: Deterministic Temporal workflow ID for webhook dedup — Nango at-least-once delivery
- Phase 1: Two-pass in-workflow relationship resolution — all targets in same batch
- Phase 2: Webhook-driven connection creation — PENDING_AUTHORIZATION and AUTHORIZING are dead code
- Phase 2: Auth webhook merged into Phase 2 so frontend connect UI can proceed in parallel after Phase 2 completes
- Phase 3: Sync webhook dispatch (HOOK-04) merged into Temporal workflow phase — tightly coupled
- [Phase 01]: IntegrationSyncStateEntity is system-managed — extends AuditableEntity only, no SoftDeletable, rows deleted via CASCADE
- [Phase 01]: New enums use @JsonProperty annotations per CLAUDE.md convention; ConnectionStatus predates this and was not modified
- [Phase 01]: Batch dedup JPQL query omits deleted=false because @SQLRestriction on EntityEntity handles it automatically
- [Phase 01]: Used ConnectionStatus.CONNECTED as default for IntegrationConnectionEntity factory — ACTIVE does not exist in ConnectionStatus enum
- [Phase 01]: Plain JUnit 5 (no @SpringBootTest) for enum and entity tests — no Spring bean or auth dependencies needed
- [Phase 02]: NangoRecord uses @JsonAnySetter for generic payload capture — enables schema-agnostic record handling across integrations
- [Phase 02]: fetchRecords() returns empty NangoRecordsPage on null response — empty page is a valid state, unlike getConnection
- [Phase 02]: NangoWebhookTags reuses end_user_email for integrationDefinitionId — Nango only provides 3 tag fields; convention documented in KDoc
- [Phase 02-01]: ConnectionStatus reduced from 10 to 8 states: PENDING_AUTHORIZATION and AUTHORIZING removed as dead states in webhook-driven model
- [Phase 02-01]: DISCONNECTED->CONNECTED and FAILED->CONNECTED transitions added for webhook reconnect path
- [Phase 02-01]: enableIntegration() and enableConnection() removed — frontend-driven enable flow eliminated in favor of webhook-driven connection creation
- [Phase 02-03]: HMAC filter uses secretKey (not webhookSecret) per established project decision
- [Phase 02-03]: Webhook controller has no @PreAuthorize — HMAC filter handles all security for the webhook endpoint
- [Phase 02-03]: Materialization failure uses compensation write pattern: catch block sets installation FAILED and saves without rethrow, preserving CONNECTED connection
- [Phase 03-01]: Nullable IntegrationSyncActivities in TemporalWorkerConfiguration: Plan 02 provides impl; nullable param with default null keeps Plan 01 compilable; Plan 02 removes nullable
- [Phase 03-01]: TestWorkflowEnvironment avoided: documented hanging issue in project; pure unit tests verify config/contracts; activity sequencing deferred to Plan 02 integration tests
- [Phase 03-01]: Temporal workflow dedup via deterministic ID sync-{connectionId}-{model} with WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted catch for Nango at-least-once delivery
- [Phase 03-02]: Open heartbeat method in IntegrationSyncActivitiesImpl — internal open for test subclass to no-op Temporal static context
- [Phase 03-02]: anyOrNull() required for nullable Mockito matchers — mockito-kotlin any() doesn't match null values for nullable Kotlin params
- [Phase 03-02]: Lazy sync state creation in finalizeSyncState — creates IntegrationSyncStateEntity if not found, no pre-seeding required
- [Phase 04]: AUTH-01/02/03 marked superseded (not completed) — Phase 2 webhook flow made original enablement requirements obsolete
- [Phase 04]: Sync script guide written as full practical reference (not architectural stub) — documents model naming, batchSave, relationship IDs, _nango_metadata semantics
- [Phase 04-01]: IntegrationHealthService has no @PreAuthorize — called from Temporal activity, no JWT context available
- [Phase 04-01]: aggregateHealth() priority: DEGRADED (any consecutiveFailureCount >= 3) > FAILED (all FAILED) > HEALTHY
- [Phase 04-01]: evaluateHealth is 4th activity for independent transaction boundary from finalizeSyncState
- [Phase 04-01]: ConnectionStatus recovery paths: DEGRADED->SYNCING and FAILED->SYNCING now valid transitions
