# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Match the entities that a human reviewer would recognize as the same real-world identity, even when the character-level representation differs significantly.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Signal-Type-Aware Normalization + Candidate Query Fixes

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project: Private methods over strategy interface — 4 strategies don't justify a plugin system
- Project: Exact-digits query for PHONE — pg_trgm blocking can't match differently-formatted phones
- Project: Static FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS skip-set — ~30 hardcoded domains, no query overhead
- Project: signal_type tag on semantic metadata — makes signal type first-class workspace config
- Project: matchSource field on CandidateMatch — default TRIGRAM for backward compat
- [Phase 01]: Hardcoded NAME_STOPWORDS and COMPANY_STOPWORDS as companion object Set constants in IdentityNormalizationService — no dynamic config needed
- [Phase 01]: COMPANY strips stopwords from end only; NAME strips from both start and end (position-aware)
- [Phase 01]: Country code strip targets only 11+ digit numbers starting with 1 (North America) — non-US numbers preserved
- [Phase 01]: Kotlin union for phone exact-digits (not SQL UNION) — simpler, dedup handled by mergeCandidates
- [Phase 01]: CANDIDATE_LIMIT bumped to 100 (was 50) to compensate for DISTINCT ON removal
- [Phase 01]: mergeCandidates groupBy key changed to (entityId, attributeId) to preserve multi-attribute entities
- [Phase 02-01]: fromColumnValue() chosen over valueOf() for CUSTOM->CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER mapping
- [Phase 02-01]: CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER as fallback when signal_type column is null (pre-existing rows)
- [Phase 02-01]: matchSource defaults to TRIGRAM for backward Temporal serialization compatibility
- [Phase 02]: Confidence gate checks DEFAULT_WEIGHTS base weight, not discounted MatchSignal.weight — prevents cross-type double-penalty
- [Phase 02]: Null candidateSignalType treated as same-type (no discount) for backward Temporal serialization compatibility
- [Phase 03]: NicknameExpander as Kotlin object (not Spring bean) — pure stateless lookup testable without Spring context
- [Phase 03]: TokenSimilarity uses overlap coefficient not Jaccard — returns 1.0 for subset containment (John vs John Smith)
- [Phase 03]: signal_type from semantic metadata overrides SchemaType for trigger signal routing — SchemaType has no NAME/COMPANY variants
- [Phase 03]: TEST-07 uses unusual hyphenation to force exact-digits path — trigram similarity below 0.3 threshold
- [Phase 04]: EmailMatcher as Kotlin object (not Spring bean) — pure stateless utility, same pattern as NicknameExpander
- [Phase 04]: FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS as private Set with 34 entries — hardcoded constant, no query overhead
- [Phase 04]: split_part() over substring() POSIX regex for domain extraction in native SQL — simpler and reliable
- [Phase 04]: EMAIL_DOMAIN tiebreaker only wins over TRIGRAM on equal score — higher trigram score still wins
- [Phase 04]: Free-domain guard in findCandidates loop, not inside findEmailDomainCandidates — private method stays single-purpose

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 introduces fuzzystrmatch PostgreSQL extension — requires discussion before adding (per CLAUDE.md rules). Already pre-approved in PROJECT.md constraints.
- CandidateMatch crosses Temporal activity boundaries — new fields (candidateSchemaType, matchSource) need Jackson-compatible defaults.
