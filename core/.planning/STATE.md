# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Every workflow node must clearly declare its output shape so the frontend can show users what data becomes available and downstream nodes can safely reference execution results.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Foundation Infrastructure)
Plan: None yet (ready to plan)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Roadmap created

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Separate BulkUpdateEntity node instead of modal UpdateEntity: Simpler — each node does one thing, one output type, one execution path (status: Pending)
- Output metadata on every node: Frontend needs to preview available data for downstream node wiring and display (status: Pending)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
