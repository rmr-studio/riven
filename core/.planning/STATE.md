# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Match the entities that a human reviewer would recognize as the same real-world identity, even when the character-level representation differs significantly.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Signal-Type-Aware Normalization + Candidate Query Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Signal-Type-Aware Normalization + Candidate Query Fixes)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-28 — Roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project: Private methods over strategy interface — 4 strategies don't justify a plugin system
- Project: Exact-digits query for PHONE — pg_trgm blocking can't match differently-formatted phones
- Project: Static FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS skip-set — ~30 hardcoded domains, no query overhead
- Project: signal_type tag on semantic metadata — makes signal type first-class workspace config
- Project: matchSource field on CandidateMatch — default TRIGRAM for backward compat
- [Phase 01]: Hardcoded NAME_STOPWORDS and COMPANY_STOPWORDS as companion object Set constants in IdentityNormalizationService — no dynamic config needed
- [Phase 01]: COMPANY strips stopwords from end only; NAME strips from both start and end (position-aware)
- [Phase 01]: Country code strip targets only 11+ digit numbers starting with 1 (North America) — non-US numbers preserved
- [Phase 01]: Kotlin union for phone exact-digits (not SQL UNION) — simpler, dedup handled by mergeCandidates
- [Phase 01]: CANDIDATE_LIMIT bumped to 100 (was 50) to compensate for DISTINCT ON removal
- [Phase 01]: mergeCandidates groupBy key changed to (entityId, attributeId) to preserve multi-attribute entities
- [Phase 02-01]: fromColumnValue() chosen over valueOf() for CUSTOM->CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER mapping
- [Phase 02-01]: CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER as fallback when signal_type column is null (pre-existing rows)
- [Phase 02-01]: matchSource defaults to TRIGRAM for backward Temporal serialization compatibility
- [Phase 02]: Confidence gate checks DEFAULT_WEIGHTS base weight, not discounted MatchSignal.weight — prevents cross-type double-penalty
- [Phase 02]: Null candidateSignalType treated as same-type (no discount) for backward Temporal serialization compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 introduces fuzzystrmatch PostgreSQL extension — requires discussion before adding (per CLAUDE.md rules). Already pre-approved in PROJECT.md constraints.
- CandidateMatch crosses Temporal activity boundaries — new fields (candidateSchemaType, matchSource) need Jackson-compatible defaults.
