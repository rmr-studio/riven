# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** End-to-end workflow lifecycle: create graph → save → execute via Temporal → see results
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Action Executors (Complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (DAG Execution Coordinator)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-12 — Completed 5-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ████████░░░░░░░░ 50% (5 phases started, 4.1 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9 (all fully complete)
- Average duration: ~43 minutes (0.72 hours)
- Total execution time: 6.51 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Expression System | 1 | 0.5h | 0.5h |
| 2 - Entity Context Integration | 1 | 3.67h | 3.67h |
| 3 - Temporal Workflow Engine | 1 | 0.28h | 0.28h |
| 4 - Action Executors | 2 | 0.88h | 0.44h |
| 4.1 - Action Execution | 3 | 0.72h | 0.24h |
| 5 - DAG Execution Coordinator | 1 | 0.07h | 0.07h |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-02 (0.13h), 4.1-01 (0.1h), 4.1-02 (0.25h), 4.1-03 (0.37h), 5-01 (0.07h)
- Trend: Excellent velocity on foundation phase, autonomous subagent execution
