# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** When a user looks at any entity in their workspace, they can see every related entity from every connected tool — turning siloed integration data into a unified identity graph.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Roadmap created

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Locked: Generic queue with job_type discriminator (INFRA-01) is the #1 prerequisite — must ship before any matching code
- Locked: GIN index must use `(value->>'value')` not `(value::text)` — wrong expression is silent failure
- Locked: Clusters form at confirmation only, never speculatively
- Locked: Signals stored as JSONB on match_suggestions, no separate table
- Locked: Canonical UUID ordering enforced via DB CHECK (source < target)
- [Phase 01-infrastructure]: workflow_definition_id is nullable on execution_queue; callers that need it non-null must check at call site (not in toModel())
- [Phase 01-infrastructure]: Dispatcher isolation enforced at SQL layer with AND job_type = 'WORKFLOW_EXECUTION' in both native queries
- [Phase 01-infrastructure]: Dedup partial unique index (workspace_id, entity_id, job_type) WHERE status='PENDING' prevents race-condition duplicate identity match jobs
- [Phase 01-infrastructure]: JSONB signals use Map<String, Any?> not kotlinx.serialization.json.JsonObject — Jackson cannot deserialize non-null kotlinx JsonObject from DB (MissingKotlinParameterException)
- [Phase 01-infrastructure]: Integration tests install pg_trgm + DB constraints in @BeforeAll — Hibernate ddl-auto:create-drop does not execute SQL schema files
- [Phase 01-infrastructure plan 00]: @EntityScan must be scoped to riven.core.entity.identity not riven.core.entity — broad scan causes uuid_generate_v4() DDL failures in test container
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: signals is List<Map<String, Any?>> not Map — JSONB array allows multi-signal breakdown per suggestion; rejectionSignals stays flat JsonObject (snapshot at rejection time)
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: MatchSignal.toMap() uses type.name (String) for JSONB serialization — avoids deserialization coupling when reading JSONB back from DB
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: fromSchemaType() maps EMAIL/PHONE directly; all others fall to CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER — NAME/COMPANY are contextual derivations handled by scoring service heuristics
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: ActivityService.logActivity requires non-null userId — activity logging skipped when userId=null for Temporal system calls
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: DataIntegrityViolationException catch is the idempotency mechanism for duplicate pair prevention
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: rejectionSignals snapshot stores signals list and confidenceScore map — enables re-suggestion context without joins
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: EntityManager used over JdbcTemplate for native queries — handles UUID parameters directly without string conversion
- [Phase 02-matching-pipeline]: MINIMUM_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.5 exposed as companion const on IdentityMatchScoringService for Plan 02-03 access without magic numbers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Verify `EntitySavedEvent` exists in codebase before Phase 3, or add publishing as Phase 3 scope
- Verify ShedLock can accommodate a second scheduled lock for identity dispatcher without contention
- NotificationService stub contract not yet defined — stub locally in identity package if needed
