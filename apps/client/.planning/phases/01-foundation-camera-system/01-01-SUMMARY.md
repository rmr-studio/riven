# Dependency graph
requires: []
provides:
  - OnboardStepConfig interface and ONBOARD_STEPS array with 4 entries (profile, workspace, templates, team)
  - useOnboardStore singleton Zustand store with goNext, goBack, skip, setStepData, reset actions
  - SECTION_WIDTH=800 constant for cameraX calculations
  - useOnboardStore re-export hook at hooks/use-onboard-store.ts
affects:
  - 01-02-split-panel-layout (imports ONBOARD_STEPS for virtual canvas dimensions)
  - 01-03-step-transitions (imports useOnboardStore for direction and currentStep)
  - 02-01-profile-step (imports useOnboardStore for setStepData)
  - 02-02-workspace-step (imports useOnboardStore for setStepData)

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Singleton Zustand store with subscribeWithSelector middleware for onboarding
    - Config array pattern for step definitions (adding steps = adding array entry only)
    - TDD with RED→GREEN cycle for stores and config tests

  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Singleton create() pattern (not createStore+context) because onboarding overlay is app-wide singleton"
  - "Placeholder PreviewComponents are inline React.FC arrow functions — replaced with wireframe skeletons in Plan 02"
  - "cameraX values computed as index * SECTION_WIDTH ensuring monotonicity and easy extensibility"

patterns-established:
  - "Step config extensibility: adding a new step requires only a new entry in ONBOARD_STEPS array"
  - "Store testing pattern: useOnboardStore.getState() and setState() without React rendering, reset() in beforeEach"

# Phase 1 Plan 01: Onboarding Store, Step Config, and Step Navigation Framework Summary

**Zustand singleton onboarding store with goNext/goBack/skip/setStepData/reset actions and a 4-entry step config array defining cameraX positions, optional flags, and placeholder PreviewComponents — 28 passing tests.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-11T06:39:54Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-11T06:42:32Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (+ 1 lint fix)
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- OnboardStepConfig interface and ONBOARD_STEPS array (profile, workspace, templates, team) with cameraX at 0/800/1600/2400
- useOnboardStore singleton with navigation clamp logic, skip guard on required steps, and step data accumulation
- 28 tests across 2 files (10 config + 18 store) all passing, no lint errors in new files

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Step config array and config tests** - `aaa939ef` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Zustand onboarding store, selector hook, and store tests** - `db5e753a` (feat)
3. **Lint fix: unused import in test file** - `bbf0a999` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** _(final docs commit — see below)_

_Note: TDD tasks had RED (failing test) → GREEN (implementation) → lint fix cycle_

## Files Created/Modified
- `components/feature-modules/onboarding/config/onboard-steps.ts` - OnboardStepConfig interface, ONBOARD_STEPS array, SECTION_WIDTH constant, placeholder PreviewComponents
- `components/feature-modules/onboarding/config/onboard-steps.test.ts` - 10 tests: structure, optional flags, cameraX monotonicity, PreviewComponent type checks
- `components/feature-modules/onboarding/stores/onboard.store.ts` - Singleton useOnboardStore with subscribeWithSelector; OnboardState, OnboardActions, OnboardStore exports
- `components/feature-modules/onboarding/stores/onboard.store.test.ts` - 18 tests: initial state, goNext/goBack bounds, skip required vs optional, setStepData merge, reset
- `components/feature-modules/onboarding/hooks/use-onboard-store.ts` - Re-export of useOnboardStore for cleaner consumer import paths

## Decisions Made
- Used singleton `create()` pattern (not `createStore` + context factory) because onboarding is a single app-wide overlay, not per-instance
- Placeholder PreviewComponents are inline `React.createElement` calls returning a div — minimal, replaced by wireframe skeletons in Plan 02
- `cameraX` computed as `index * SECTION_WIDTH` so it stays correct automatically if step order changes

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Removed unused OnboardStepConfig import in test file**
- **Found during:** Post-task lint check
- **Issue:** `OnboardStepConfig` was imported in the test file but not referenced — `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` error
- **Fix:** Removed the unused import; tests verify structure via duck-typing (checking property existence) rather than requiring the type
- **Files modified:** `components/feature-modules/onboarding/config/onboard-steps.test.ts`
- **Verification:** `npm run lint` shows no onboarding-related errors; all 10 config tests still pass
- **Committed in:** `bbf0a999`

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (Rule 1 - bug/lint)
**Impact on plan:** Trivial import cleanup. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None — all pre-existing lint errors in `entity.store.ts`, `entity-instance-validation.util.ts`, and `utils.ts` are out of scope for this plan.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Store and config contracts are fully established; Plan 02 (split-panel layout) can import ONBOARD_STEPS for canvas dimensions and useOnboardStore for step state
- Placeholder PreviewComponents are ready to be replaced with wireframe skeletons in Plan 02
- No blockers
