## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Form-per-step with Zustand consolidation (from research). Each step owns its react-hook-form instance, writes validated data to store.
- [Roadmap]: Profile update must happen LAST in submission sequence (user.name is onboarding gate).
- [Roadmap]: Template catalog may need mock data if backend endpoint not ready (flagged for Phase 3).
- [Phase 01-01]: Singleton create() for onboarding store (not createStore+context) — onboarding is app-wide singleton
- [Phase 01-01]: cameraX = index * SECTION_WIDTH (800) ensures monotonicity and extensibility
- [Phase 01-foundation-camera-system]: Three-phase camera animation locked at 200ms each (600ms total) — not configurable per user decision
- [Phase 01-foundation-camera-system]: isAnimating ref guards rapid navigation to prevent animation conflicts without triggering re-renders

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Template catalog API availability unknown -- Phase 3 may need mock data initially.
- Existing invite component needs audit -- may be outdated (Phase 3).
