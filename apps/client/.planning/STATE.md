# Project State: Entity Relationship Migration

**Last updated:** 2026-03-04
**Session:** Phase 3 Plan 01 — Relationship form data layer

---

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The entity type configuration flow must cleanly separate attribute definitions from relationship definitions while keeping the UX simple and unified.

**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Relationship Form (in progress)

---

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Active phase | 3 — Relationship Form |
| Active plan | 03-02 (complete) |
| Phase status | In progress |
| Overall progress | 2 / 5 phases complete |

```
Progress: [####______] 40%
Phase 1: [x] Type Foundation
Phase 2: [x] Service + Hooks
Phase 3: [~] Relationship Form (2/3 plans complete)
Phase 4: [ ] Creation Form Simplification
Phase 5: [ ] Attribute Semantic Configuration
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases defined | 5 |
| Requirements mapped | 34/34 |
| Plans complete | 3 |
| Phases complete | 2/5 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Compress 6 research phases into 4 | Depth is "quick"; service layer and mutation hooks have tight coupling and compress naturally |
| Phase 4 (creation form) sequenced last | Independent of the relationship layer; lower risk; can proceed after Phase 1 if needed |
| Start cache updates with invalidateQueries | Safe baseline until response shape of new relationship endpoints is confirmed from KnowledgeApi.ts |
| Do not create a separate RelationshipDefinitionService | Same API endpoint (`saveEntityTypeDefinition`) handles both; extend EntityTypeService only |
| Do not add a relationshipDefinitions cache key | Relationships come back embedded in EntityTypeImpactResponse.updatedEntityTypes — entity type cache is the source of truth |
| Expand existing phases for semantics | Keeps related work together (types with types, service with service, form with form) rather than isolating all semantic work |
| PUT semantics for metadata saves | Backend enforces full replacement — UI must always send complete metadata objects, not deltas |
| Use 'ONE'/'UNLIMITED' string literals for cardinality limits | Avoids z.nativeEnum(RelationshipLimit) serialization issues with numeric enum; cleaner Zod schema |
| cachedRulesRef returned from hook (not managed in hook) | UI layer can apply create vs edit mode polymorphic toggle semantics without leaking context into the data hook |
| ruleValues[index]?.id for isExistingRule detection | field.id from useFieldArray is always a generated UUID; form value .id is only set from server data in edit mode |
| EntityTypeSingleSelect inlined in target-rule-item | Single-file-per-component; tightly coupled to form context and not reused elsewhere |

### Critical Pitfalls (from research)

1. EntityRelationshipDefinition (old) and RelationshipDefinition (new) coexist in generated models — TypeScript will not catch accidental cross-usage. Enforce strict types at service method boundaries.
2. New endpoint response shape is unconfirmed — inspect KnowledgeApi.ts before writing Phase 2 onSuccess handlers.
3. Form must be rewritten from scratch against SaveRelationshipDefinitionRequest, not extended from the old schema.
4. entityTypeKey (string) vs entityTypeId (UUID) — resolve keys to IDs in the service layer before building SaveTargetRuleRequest.
5. Stale modal form state — reset synchronously on onOpenChange(false), not with setTimeout(500).
6. KnowledgeApi uses PUT semantics — omitting a field (e.g., `definition`) clears it on the server. Always read-then-merge in the mutation hook's onMutate or construct complete objects from form state.
7. SemanticMetadataBundle returns Maps keyed by target UUID — must match attribute/relationship IDs correctly when rendering inline.
8. Lifecycle hooks auto-initialize empty metadata records — the query hook may return metadata with null definition/classification. UI must handle empty state gracefully (show placeholder, not "null").

### TODOs and Blockers

- [ ] Before writing Phase 2: confirm response shape of saveEntityTypeDefinition when called with a relationship request by reading KnowledgeApi.ts
- [ ] After Phase 2: verify EntityType from getEntityTypeByKey still embeds relationship definitions correctly (run against live backend)
- [ ] After Phase 2: confirm RelationshipLink/RelationshipCandidate overlap detection panel still populates correctly
- [ ] Before Phase 2: Read KnowledgeApi.ts to confirm request/response shapes for all 8 endpoints
- [ ] Phase 5: Decide whether attribute semantic editing is inline in the schema table row, an expandable section, or a side panel

### Notes

- Mode is "yolo" with parallelization enabled — phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel once phase 2 is complete. Phase 5 can also run in parallel with Phase 3 once Phase 2 is complete (both depend on Phase 2 for service/hooks, but are independent of each other).
- One new API factory needed: KnowledgeApi (for semantic metadata). No new libraries, stores, or routing needed beyond that.
- The attribute type dropdown (AttributeTypeDropdown) is the preserved entry point for both attributes and relationships — do not replace with separate flows
- Total phases: 5. Total v1 requirements: 34.

## Session Continuity

To resume this project:

1. Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase structure and success criteria
2. Read `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for requirement IDs and traceability
3. Check phase progress in the table above
4. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1 planning
