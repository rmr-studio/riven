# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Form-per-step with Zustand consolidation (from research). Each step owns its react-hook-form instance, writes validated data to store.
- [Roadmap]: Profile update must happen LAST in submission sequence (user.name is onboarding gate).
- [Roadmap]: Template catalog may need mock data if backend endpoint not ready (flagged for Phase 3).
- [Phase 01-01]: Singleton create() for onboarding store (not createStore+context) — onboarding is app-wide singleton
- [Phase 01-01]: cameraX = index * SECTION_WIDTH (800) ensures monotonicity and extensibility
- [Phase 01-foundation-camera-system]: Three-phase camera animation locked at 200ms each (600ms total) — not configurable per user decision
- [Phase 01-foundation-camera-system]: isAnimating ref guards rapid navigation to prevent animation conflicts without triggering re-renders
- [Phase 02-required-steps]: formTrigger bridge pattern: store acts as decoupled bridge between nav controls and step form, no prop drilling
- [Phase 02-required-steps]: liveData stays unvalidated for preview reactivity; validatedData receives committed data only on successful Next
- [Phase 02-required-steps]: avatar-helpers extracted to utils/ to avoid duplication between profile-preview and workspace-preview
- [Phase 02-required-steps]: Plan selector uses clickable cards with shouldValidate:false — validation only on Next click
- [Phase 03-optional-steps]: INVITE_ROLES excludes WorkspaceRoles.Owner — only Admin and Member selectable during onboarding
- [Phase 03-optional-steps]: Soft cap at 10 invites with informational message rather than hard block
- [Phase 03-optional-steps]: toggleBundleSelection exported as pure helper for test isolation without React/DOM setup
- [Phase 03-optional-steps]: useBundles fetches both listBundles and listTemplates in single Promise.all with query key ['bundles']
- [Phase 03-optional-steps]: Optional step formTrigger pattern: always-true async function, liveData provides reactivity without validation
- [Phase 04-submission-completion]: assemblePayload is a pure function for full unit testability without React/DOM setup
- [Phase 04-submission-completion]: No toast on submission error — inline error state in form panel per CONTEXT.md spec
- [Phase 04-submission-completion]: templateKeys always empty — templates installed via bundles, not individually

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Template catalog API availability unknown -- Phase 3 may need mock data initially.
- Existing invite component needs audit -- may be outdated (Phase 3).
