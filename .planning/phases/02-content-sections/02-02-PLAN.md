<objective>
Create the Features section that presents Riven capabilities as user benefits with visual icons.

Purpose: Show visitors how Riven solves the pain points they just read about, focusing on outcomes not features.
Output: Features component with 4 feature cards, each with lucide-react icon, benefit-focused copy, and scroll animations.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Features section component</name>
  <files>landing/components/sections/features.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the Features section component with icon-based feature cards.

Structure:
1. "use client" directive (required for Framer Motion)
2. Imports:
   - motion from framer-motion
   - Blocks, Workflow, GitBranch, LayoutTemplate from lucide-react
   - LucideIcon type from lucide-react

3. Define Feature interface: { icon: LucideIcon; title: string; benefit: string }

4. Define features array with 4 items (benefit-focused copy, not feature descriptions):
   - Custom entity model (Blocks icon): "Define your own objects and relationships. Contacts, deals, projects - whatever your business needs."
   - Workflow automation (Workflow icon): "Automate repetitive tasks without a PhD in automation. If-this-then-that, but actually useful."
   - Non-linear pipelines (GitBranch icon): "Deals branch, loop back, and skip stages. Your pipeline should reflect that."
   - Templates (LayoutTemplate icon): "Start with pre-built templates for common workflows. Customize everything from day one."

5. Define animation variants:
   - containerVariants: staggerChildren: 0.1, delayChildren: 0.1
   - itemVariants: opacity 0->1, y 20->0, duration 0.4

6. Export Features component:
   - section with py-20 lg:py-32 bg-muted/30 (subtle background differentiation)
   - Container div with container mx-auto px-4
   - Header: motion.div with "Built for how you actually work" h2 and subheadline "Riven adapts to your business, not the other way around."
   - Grid: motion.div with grid gap-8 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
   - Feature cards: motion.div with flex flex-col items-center text-center p-6
   - Icon container: div with mb-4 rounded-lg bg-primary/10 p-3
   - Icon: feature.icon with h-6 w-6 text-primary
   - whileInView="visible" viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.1 }} on motion containers

Key: Icons are rendered as `<feature.icon className="h-6 w-6 text-primary" />` where feature.icon is the LucideIcon component.
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at landing/components/sections/features.tsx.
Contains "use client" directive.
Contains "export function Features".
Contains imports from lucide-react (Blocks, Workflow, GitBranch, LayoutTemplate).
Contains 4 feature items in array with icon, title, benefit.
Contains motion components with whileInView.
  </verify>
  <done>
Features component exists with 4 features, icons, benefit-focused copy, and scroll animations.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Features to landing page</name>
  <files>landing/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update page.tsx to import and render Features section.

1. Add import: import { Features } from "@/components/sections/features";
2. Add Features component after PainPoints in the main element (or after Hero if PainPoints not yet added)

The page should render sections in order: Hero, PainPoints (if exists), Features.
  </action>

Run: cd /home/jared/dev/riven-landing-worktree/landing && npm run build
Build completes without errors.

  <done>
Landing page renders Features section. Build passes.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. npm run build succeeds in landing directory
2. Features section file exists with expected structure
3. page.tsx imports and renders Features
4. Icons import correctly from lucide-react
5. No TypeScript errors
