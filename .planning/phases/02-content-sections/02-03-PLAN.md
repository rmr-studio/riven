<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create FinalCTA section component</name>
  <files>landing/components/sections/final-cta.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the Final CTA section component that reuses WaitlistForm.

Structure:
1. Import WaitlistForm from "@/components/waitlist-form"
2. No "use client" needed (WaitlistForm is already a client component)

3. Export FinalCTA component:
   - section with py-20 lg:py-32 bg-muted/50 (slightly stronger background than features)
   - Container div with container mx-auto px-4
   - Centered content: div with mx-auto max-w-2xl text-center
   - Headline (h2): "Ready to build a CRM that fits?" - text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight sm:text-4xl
   - Subheadline (p): "Join the waitlist and be first to try Riven." - mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground
   - Form wrapper: div with mt-8
   - WaitlistForm: className="max-w-md mx-auto" (centered, constrained width)

No animations needed for CTA section - it's the destination, not a reveal.
Keep it simple and focused on conversion.
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at landing/components/sections/final-cta.tsx.
Contains "export function FinalCTA".
Contains import of WaitlistForm.
Contains WaitlistForm component usage.
  </verify>
  <done>
FinalCTA component exists with reinforcement headline and WaitlistForm reuse.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Complete landing page with all sections</name>
  <files>landing/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update page.tsx to import and render FinalCTA as the final section.

1. Add import: import { FinalCTA } from "@/components/sections/final-cta";
2. Add FinalCTA component as the last section in main element

Final page structure should be:
- Hero (existing)
- PainPoints (from 02-01)
- Features (from 02-02)
- FinalCTA (this plan)

If PainPoints or Features imports don't exist yet (parallel execution), add them.
The page should import and render all 4 sections in order.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: cd /home/jared/dev/riven-landing-worktree/landing && npm run build
Build completes without errors.
Page.tsx contains imports for Hero, PainPoints, Features, FinalCTA.
Page.tsx renders all 4 sections in order.
  </verify>
  <done>
Landing page renders complete section flow: Hero -> PainPoints -> Features -> FinalCTA. Build passes.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. npm run build succeeds in landing directory
2. FinalCTA section file exists with WaitlistForm reuse
3. page.tsx imports and renders all 4 sections in order
4. WaitlistForm functionality preserved (same states work)
5. No TypeScript errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- CTA-01: Secondary waitlist form at page bottom
- CTA-02: Reinforcement headline "Ready to build a CRM that fits?"
- CTA-03: Reuses WaitlistForm component exactly (no modifications)
- Complete page flow: Hero -> PainPoints -> Features -> FinalCTA
- Form shares mutation state (success in hero = success in CTA)
- Build passes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-content-sections/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
