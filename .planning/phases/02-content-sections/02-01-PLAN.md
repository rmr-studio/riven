<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create PainPoints section component</name>
  <files>landing/components/sections/pain-points.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the Pain Points section component following established patterns from hero.tsx.

Structure:
1. "use client" directive (required for Framer Motion)
2. Import motion from framer-motion
3. Define PainPoint interface: { title: string; description: string }
4. Define painPoints array with 4 items:
   - "Forced into rigid pipelines" - deals don't follow linear path
   - "One-size-fits-none data model" - custom fields aren't enough
   - "Automation that fights you" - workflows hard to set up and debug
   - "Built for enterprise, priced for enterprise" - paying for unneeded features

5. Define animation variants:
   - containerVariants: staggerChildren: 0.1
   - itemVariants: opacity 0->1, y 20->0, duration 0.4

6. Export PainPoints component:
   - section with py-20 lg:py-32 (matches hero pattern)
   - Container div with container mx-auto px-4
   - Header: motion.div with "Sound familiar?" h2 and subheadline
   - Grid: motion.div with grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2
   - Cards: motion.div for each pain point with rounded-lg border border-border bg-background p-6
   - whileInView="visible" viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }} on motion containers

Use existing design tokens: text-muted-foreground, border-border, bg-background.
Do NOT create any new color variables - use what exists in globals.css.
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at landing/components/sections/pain-points.tsx.
Contains "use client" directive.
Contains "export function PainPoints".
Contains 4 pain point items in array.
Contains motion components with whileInView.
  </verify>
  <done>
PainPoints component exists with 4 pain points, scroll animations, and matches hero section layout pattern.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add PainPoints to landing page</name>
  <files>landing/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update page.tsx to import and render PainPoints section after Hero.

1. Add import: import { PainPoints } from "@/components/sections/pain-points";
2. Add PainPoints component after Hero in the main element

The page should now render: Hero, then PainPoints.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: cd /home/jared/dev/riven-landing-worktree/landing && npm run build
Build completes without errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
Landing page renders Hero section followed by PainPoints section. Build passes.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. npm run build succeeds in landing directory
2. PainPoints section file exists with expected structure
3. page.tsx imports and renders PainPoints after Hero
4. No TypeScript errors in the component
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- PAIN-01: Section header "Sound familiar?" introduces problem space
- PAIN-02: 4 specific pain points about rigid CRMs
- PAIN-03: Pain points target founders/small teams (enterprise pricing, VCR reference)
- Section uses established design tokens and layout patterns
- Build passes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-content-sections/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
