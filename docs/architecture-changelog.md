# Architecture Changelog

## 2026-03-17 — Identity Match Dispatch Infrastructure and EntityService Event Publishing

**Domains affected:** Identity, Entity, Workflow

**What changed:**

- Created `IdentityMatchQueueProcessorService`: claims IDENTITY_MATCH items from the execution queue and starts `IdentityMatchWorkflow` on the `identity.match` Temporal task queue; handles `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted` as idempotent success
- Created `IdentityMatchDispatcherService`: `@Scheduled` + `@SchedulerLock` poller for the IDENTITY_MATCH queue and stale item recovery; uses unique ShedLock names (`processIdentityMatchQueue`, `recoverStaleIdentityMatchItems`) to avoid contention with the workflow execution dispatcher
- Removed `@ConditionalOnProperty(riven.workflow.engine.enabled)` from `WorkflowExecutionDispatcherService` and `WorkflowExecutionQueueProcessorService` — Temporal is a required infrastructure dependency, not optional
- `EntityService` now publishes `IdentityMatchTriggerEvent` after every `saveEntity()` call; only IDENTIFIER-classified attribute values are included (via `EntityTypeClassificationService`); event fires within the `@Transactional` boundary so `@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)` in the listener fires post-commit
- Full pipeline is now wired: `EntityService` → `IdentityMatchTriggerEvent` → `IdentityMatchTriggerListener` → `IdentityMatchQueueService` → execution queue → `IdentityMatchDispatcherService` → `IdentityMatchQueueProcessorService` → Temporal `IdentityMatchWorkflow`

**New cross-domain dependencies:** Yes — `EntityService` (Entity domain) → `EntityTypeClassificationService` (Identity domain) via constructor injection for IDENTIFIER attribute ID lookup

**New components introduced:**

- `IdentityMatchQueueProcessorService` — Per-item REQUIRES_NEW processor that starts IdentityMatchWorkflow via WorkflowClient with retry/fail logic
- `IdentityMatchDispatcherService` — Scheduled batch poller and stale recovery service for the IDENTITY_MATCH execution queue

## 2026-03-09 — Entity Attributes Normalization

**Domains affected:** Entities

**What changed:**

- Extracted entity attribute storage from JSONB `payload` column on `entities` table into normalized `entity_attributes` table (one row per attribute per entity)
- `EntityEntity.payload` JSONB column removed; `EntityEntity.toModel()` now accepts optional `attributes` parameter
- `AttributeSqlGenerator` completely rewritten — JSONB operators (`@>`, `->`, `->>`) replaced with EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries against `entity_attributes`. ObjectMapper dependency removed.
- `EntityService` save flow now persists attributes to `entity_attributes` via `EntityAttributeService` (delete-all + re-insert). All retrieval methods batch-load attributes.
- `EntityService` delete flow soft-deletes attributes via `EntityAttributeService.softDeleteByEntityIds()`
- `EntityQueryService` now hydrates query results with attributes from normalized table
- `EntityValidationService.validateEntity()` and `validateExistingEntitiesAgainstNewSchema()` accept optional attributes parameters (read from normalized table instead of entity payload)
- `EntityTypeAttributeService` loads attributes from normalized table during breaking change validation
- Cross-domain consumers (`BlockReferenceHydrationService`, `EntityContextService`) now inject `EntityAttributeService` for attribute loading

**New cross-domain dependencies:** No (both cross-domain consumers already depended on Entities domain)

**New components introduced:**

- `EntityAttributeService` — Service for normalized attribute CRUD with delete-all + re-insert pattern
- `EntityAttributeRepository` — JPA repository with derived queries, native hard-delete, and native soft-delete
- `EntityAttributeEntity` — JPA entity mapping to `entity_attributes` table with JSONB value column and soft-delete support

## 2026-03-01 — Unified Relationship CRUD (Connection → Relationship refactor)

**Domains affected:** Entities

**What changed:**

- Replaced "connection" CRUD on `EntityRelationshipService` with unified "relationship" CRUD — `addRelationship`, `getRelationships`, `updateRelationship`, `removeRelationship`
- `addRelationship` accepts optional `definitionId` — when provided, creates a typed relationship with target type validation and cardinality enforcement; when omitted, falls back to the system `CONNECTED_ENTITIES` definition
- `getRelationships` returns ALL relationships for an entity (both fallback and typed), with optional `definitionId` filter — previously only returned fallback connections
- `updateRelationship` and `removeRelationship` work on any relationship regardless of definition type — removed `validateIsFallbackConnection` guard
- Controller endpoints renamed: `/connections` → `/relationships` with corresponding method renames
- Request models renamed: `CreateConnectionRequest` → `AddRelationshipRequest`, `UpdateConnectionRequest` → `UpdateRelationshipRequest`
- Response model renamed: `ConnectionResponse` → `RelationshipResponse` — now includes `definitionId` and `definitionName`
- Activity logging uses `Activity.ENTITY_RELATIONSHIP` for new operations — `Activity.ENTITY_CONNECTION` retained in enum for backwards compatibility with existing log entries
- Duplicate detection: bidirectional for fallback definitions (A→B or B→A), directional for typed definitions (A→B only under that definition)

**New cross-domain dependencies:** No

**New components introduced:**

- `AddRelationshipRequest` — Request model with optional `definitionId` for unified relationship creation
- `UpdateRelationshipRequest` — Request model for semantic context updates
- `RelationshipResponse` — Response model including definition metadata

## 2026-02-21 — Entity Relationship Overhaul

**Domains affected:** Entities, Workflows

**What changed:**

- Replaced ORIGIN/REFERENCE bidirectional relationship sync pattern with table-based architecture using `relationship_definitions` and `relationship_target_rules` tables
- Inverse rows are no longer stored — bidirectional visibility is resolved at query time via `inverseVisible` flag on `RelationshipTargetRuleEntity`
- Deleted `EntityTypeRelationshipDiffService` and `EntityTypeRelationshipImpactAnalysisService` — diff logic consolidated into `EntityTypeRelationshipService` target rule diffing, impact analysis uses simple two-pass pattern
- `EntityTypeRelationshipService` entirely rewritten — new CRUD interface managing definitions and target rules directly
- `EntityRelationshipService` entirely rewritten — write-time cardinality enforcement (source-side and target-side), target type validation against definition rules, no more bidirectional sync
- `EntityTypeService` updated — removed DiffService/ImpactAnalysisService dependencies, added `RelationshipDefinitionRepository` and `EntityRelationshipRepository` for direct access
- `EntityService` updated — relationship payload now keyed by definition ID, delegates relationship saves per-definition to `EntityRelationshipService`
- `EntityQueryService` updated — loads relationship definitions to resolve FORWARD/INVERSE query direction before SQL generation
- `RelationshipSqlGenerator` updated — new `direction: QueryDirection` parameter, column renamed from `relationship_field_id` to `relationship_definition_id`
- `AttributeFilterVisitor` updated — passes `relationshipDirections` map through to SQL generator
- `QueryFilterValidator` updated — now uses `RelationshipDefinition` model instead of `EntityRelationshipDefinition`
- `EntityContextService` (Workflows domain) updated — loads definitions via `RelationshipDefinitionRepository` and `RelationshipTargetRuleRepository` instead of reading from EntityType JSONB schema

**New cross-domain dependencies:** Yes — Workflows → Entities: `EntityContextService` now injects `RelationshipDefinitionRepository` and `RelationshipTargetRuleRepository` (deepening existing coupling)

**New components introduced:**

- `RelationshipDefinitionEntity` — JPA entity for schema-level relationship configuration (replaces JSONB `relationships` field on EntityTypeEntity)
- `RelationshipTargetRuleEntity` — JPA entity for per-target-type configuration with cardinality overrides and inverse visibility
- `RelationshipDefinition` — Domain model for relationship definitions
- `RelationshipTargetRule` — Domain model for target rules
- `RelationshipDefinitionRepository` — JPA repository with workspace-scoped queries
- `RelationshipTargetRuleRepository` — JPA repository with inverse-visible queries
- `QueryDirection` enum — FORWARD vs INVERSE for SQL generation
- `DeleteDefinitionImpact` — Simple data class for two-pass impact pattern (replaces complex `EntityTypeRelationshipImpactAnalysis`)

## 2026-03-16 — Identity Resolution Feature Design Populated

**Domains affected:** Entities, Integrations

**What changed:**

- Populated the Identity Resolution feature design document from draft template to full specification, synthesizing content from CEO review (PLAN-REVIEW), engineering review (ENG-REVIEW), PROJECT, ROADMAP, and REQUIREMENTS planning documents
- Moved feature design from `1. Planning/` to `2. Planned/` in the feature design pipeline
- Document covers: data model (3 new tables), component design (5 services, 3 JPA entities, controller), 7 API endpoints, 16 failure modes, 15 architectural decisions, 5-phase implementation roadmap mapped to 30 requirements

**New cross-domain dependencies:** Yes — Entities → Identity (new): `EntityService` will publish `EntitySavedEvent` consumed by `IdentityMatchTriggerService`. Identity → Entities: `IdentityMatchConfirmationService` creates relationships via `EntityRelationshipService` and reads attributes via `entity_attributes` table.

**New components introduced:**

- Feature design document only — no code components introduced in this change. The document specifies components to be built across 5 implementation phases.

## 2026-04-15 — Insights Chat Demo Domain

**Domains affected:** Insights (new), Entities, Identity

**What changed:**

- Introduced a new `insights` domain providing a workspace-scoped, multi-turn AI chat demo (Anthropic Messages API) that cites real entities and identity clusters
- Added `insights_chat_sessions` and `insights_messages` tables; both are user-facing soft-deletable
- Added a `demo_session_id` column to `entities` and `identity_clusters` so demo-seeded rows can be cleaned up when a session is deleted (intentionally demo-scoped tech debt)
- Added the `INSIGHTS_CHAT_SESSION` and `INSIGHTS_MESSAGE` values to `Activity` and `ApplicationEntityType` enums for audit logging
- Added `LlmCallException` and `LlmResponseParseException` mapped to HTTP 502 in `ExceptionHandler`

**New cross-domain dependencies:** Yes — Insights → Entities: `DemoSeederService` and `CitationValidator` use `EntityRepository` and `EntityTypeRepository`. Insights → Identity: `DemoSeederService` writes `IdentityClusterEntity`/`IdentityClusterMemberEntity`. Insights → external LLM provider: `AnthropicChatClient` calls the Anthropic Messages API.

**New components introduced:**

- `InsightsService` — orchestrates session lifecycle, demo-pool seeding, LLM dispatch, citation validation, and message persistence
- `DemoSeederService` — idempotent ephemeral demo entity/cluster seeder keyed by `demo_session_id`
- `AnthropicChatClient` — thin Anthropic Messages API client with system-prompt caching and JSON assistant prefill
- `PromptBuilder` — assembles the cached system prompt + chat history
- `InsightsResponseParser` — parses the LLM `{answer, citations}` envelope, tolerant to assistant prefill quirks
- `CitationValidator` — drops citations whose entity ids aren't in the seeded pool, are soft-deleted, or belong to a different workspace
- `InsightsController` — REST endpoints under `/api/v1/insights/workspace/{workspaceId}/sessions`
- `InsightsChatSessionEntity`, `InsightsMessageEntity`, `InsightsChatSessionRepository`, `InsightsMessageRepository`
- `AnthropicConfigurationProperties` (`riven.insights.anthropic.*`) and `InsightsWebClientConfig` for the WebClient bean

## [2026-04-15] — Insights demo seeder enrichment (attributes + relationships)

**Domains affected:** Insights, Entity

**What changed:**

- `DemoSeederService` now populates `EntityAttributeEntity` rows for seeded customer and feature-usage-event entities, matching attribute ids from the existing workspace `EntityTypeSchema` via semantic label/key matches. Tolerant of missing attributes — skips gracefully.
- `DemoSeederService` now creates `EntityRelationshipEntity` rows linking each seeded event → its owning customer, using the first `RelationshipDefinitionEntity` with the event entity type as source (preferring definitions whose name contains "source" or "customer"). Skips silently if no definition exists.
- `cleanupPoolForSession` now explicitly soft-deletes attributes and relationships for demo-tagged entities (neither cascades via JPA).
- `buildPoolSummary` now embeds key attribute values (name, plan, LTV, feature, action, count, date) and the event → customer linkage in the per-line summary. Caps customers and events-per-customer in the summary to keep the cached system prompt compact.

**New cross-domain dependencies:** No new directions — tightens the existing Insights → Entity dependency to also include `EntityAttributeRepository`, `EntityRelationshipRepository`, and `RelationshipDefinitionRepository`.

**New components introduced:** None — `DemoSeederService` constructor grew three new repository dependencies and an `ObjectMapper` for JSONB value construction.

## [2026-04-15] — Insights chat now consumes workspace business definitions

**Domains affected:** insights, knowledge
**What changed:**
- InsightsService reads active WorkspaceBusinessDefinitions per request and passes them to PromptBuilder, which renders them inside the cached system prefix so the LLM frames answers using workspace-specific terminology.

**New cross-domain dependencies:** yes — insights → knowledge via WorkspaceBusinessDefinitionService.
**New components introduced:** none (existing service reused).

## [2026-04-15] — Insights suggested-prompts endpoint

**Domains affected:** insights
**What changed:**
- New GET /api/v1/insights/workspace/{id}/demo/suggested-prompts endpoint returns a curated, data-signal-aware list of demo-ready prompts.
- New InsightsDemoService probes workspace for entity-type, cluster, and active-business-definition signals and scores/filters a prompt catalog accordingly.

**New cross-domain dependencies:** no (reuses existing knowledge + identity + entity services).
**New components introduced:** InsightsDemoService (prompt-catalog scorer).

## [2026-04-15] — Insights demo ensure-ready seeding

**Domains affected:** insights, knowledge
**What changed:**
- New POST /api/v1/insights/workspace/{id}/demo/ensure-ready endpoint idempotently seeds 5 curated business definitions (valuable customer, active customer, power user, at risk, retention) via WorkspaceBusinessDefinitionService.createDefinitionInternal.
- Definitions are categorised as METRIC/LIFECYCLE_STAGE/SEGMENT/STATUS/METRIC respectively. Idempotency is enforced by normalized-term lookup.

**New cross-domain dependencies:** no (insights→knowledge already exists).
**New components introduced:** none (extends InsightsDemoService).

## [2026-04-15] — Insights chat switches to inline entity citations

**Domains affected:** insights
**What changed:**
- System prompt now instructs the LLM to emit entity citations as inline markdown links `[label](entity:<uuid>)` and to avoid all other markdown.
- Server derives `citations[]` by parsing those markers from the answer, validating UUIDs against the seeded pool (entities + identity clusters), and populating `entityType` from pool metadata. Invalid/missing citations are stripped (label text preserved). Non-link markdown is defensively stripped.
- New `InlineCitationExtractor` + `AnswerSanitizer` path; `InsightsResponseParser` no longer trusts model-emitted citation arrays (parses `{answer}` only, tolerates a stray `citations` field for backward compat). `CitationValidator` removed (replaced by sanitizer).

**New cross-domain dependencies:** no.
**New components introduced:** InlineCitationExtractor (Spring component, regex-based marker parser); AnswerSanitizer (Spring component, strips stray markdown and derives validated citations).

## [2026-04-15] — Insights per-message demo augmentation

**Domains affected:** insights
**What changed:**
- Every user message now triggers a short LLM planner call (DemoAugmentationPlanner) that proposes small additions to the demo pool tailored to the question — new customers, new events, cluster memberships.
- Additions are applied via DemoSeederService.applyAugmentationPlan under hard caps (<=8 customers, <=30 events per turn) and tagged with demo_session_id so session-delete still cleans them up.
- Planner or applier failures degrade gracefully: log WARN and proceed with the existing pool.

**New cross-domain dependencies:** no.
**New components introduced:** DemoAugmentationPlanner (Spring component; question-aware pool growth via a compact secondary LLM call).
