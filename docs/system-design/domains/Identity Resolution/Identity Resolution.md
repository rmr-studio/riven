# Identity Resolution

## Overview

Identity Resolution detects duplicate entities within a workspace using pg_trgm trigram similarity, weighted scoring, and human-reviewable match suggestions. The pipeline runs as a Temporal-orchestrated background process, currently triggered only via domain events (entity save/update) — there are no REST API endpoints.

## Boundaries

**Owns:**
- Candidate finding (pg_trgm blocking via GIN index)
- Scoring (weighted signals with configurable per-signal-type weights)
- Suggestion persistence (idempotent creation, re-suggestion, rejection)
- Cluster entities (scaffolded for future use)
- Temporal workflow orchestration for the matching pipeline

**Does NOT own:**
- Entity CRUD (Entities domain)
- Queue infrastructure (Workflows domain — ExecutionQueueEntity)
- Activity logging (Activity domain)
- User authentication

## Sub-Domains

| Sub-Domain | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [[Matching Pipeline]] | Candidate finding, scoring, suggestion management, queue dispatch, classification cache | Active |
| [[Clusters]] | Entity grouping into confirmed identity clusters | Scaffolded |
| [[Temporal Integration]] | Workflow and activity orchestration for the matching pipeline | Active |

## Flows

| Flow | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [[Flow - Identity Match Pipeline]] | Background | Entity save → event → queue → Temporal → candidates → scoring → suggestions |

## Data

### Owned Entities

| Entity | Table | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MatchSuggestionEntity | match_suggestions | Candidate pair for human review — JSONB signals, canonical UUID ordering, soft-deletable |
| IdentityClusterEntity | identity_clusters | Workspace-scoped cluster container with member count tracking, soft-deletable |
| IdentityClusterMemberEntity | identity_cluster_members | Join table linking entities to clusters — hard-deleted (not AuditableSoftDeletableEntity) |

## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Temporal Server | Workflow orchestration — identity.match task queue, activity retry policies |
| PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension | Trigram similarity search for fuzzy candidate matching via GIN index |

## Domain Interactions

### Depends On

| Domain | Interaction |
|---|---|
| Entities | Queries `entity_attributes` and `entity_type_semantic_metadata` via native SQL for IDENTIFIER-classified attributes |
| Workflows | Uses `ExecutionQueueEntity` and queue infrastructure for IDENTITY_MATCH job dispatch |
| Activity | Uses `ActivityService` for audit logging of suggestion create/reject |

### Consumed By

Nothing currently — no REST API, no external consumers. Triggered internally via domain events published by EntityService.

## Service Summary

| Sub-Domain | Service | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Matching Pipeline | [[IdentityMatchCandidateService]] | pg_trgm candidate finding — two-phase GIN index blocking + similarity threshold |
| Matching Pipeline | [[IdentityMatchScoringService]] | Weighted scoring — pure computation, weighted average with configurable per-signal-type weights |
| Matching Pipeline | [[IdentityMatchSuggestionService]] | Suggestion persistence — idempotent creation, re-suggestion on improved score, rejection |
| Matching Pipeline | EntityTypeClassificationService | Cached IDENTIFIER attribute lookup for entity types using ConcurrentHashMap |
| Matching Pipeline | IdentityMatchQueueService | IDENTITY_MATCH job enqueueing with deduplication via partial unique index |
| Matching Pipeline | IdentityMatchDispatcherService | Scheduled queue polling (every 5s) with ShedLock distributed locking |
| Matching Pipeline | IdentityMatchQueueProcessorService | Per-item processing with REQUIRES_NEW transactions — dispatches to Temporal |
| Temporal Integration | IdentityMatchWorkflowImpl | Temporal workflow — deterministic orchestration of 3-activity pipeline with short-circuit |
| Temporal Integration | IdentityMatchActivitiesImpl | Temporal activities — thin delegation to CandidateService, ScoringService, SuggestionService |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| pg_trgm for fuzzy matching | Keeps the stack simple — avoids introducing Elasticsearch or a separate search service. GIN index provides fast blocking. |
| Canonical UUID ordering (source < target) | Prevents duplicate pairs. Enforced both in application code and via DB CHECK constraint. |
| Soft-delete on rejection | Enables re-suggestion comparison — new scores can be compared against rejected scores to determine if a re-suggestion is warranted. |
| No @PreAuthorize annotations | Called from Temporal without JWT context. Workspace isolation enforced at query level in WHERE clauses. |
| Dedicated IDENTITY_MATCH queue type | Isolates identity match jobs from the default workflow queue, enabling independent polling and scaling. |

## Technical Debt

- Cluster entities are scaffolded but no services exist yet — pending future phase for confirmed match grouping.
- No REST API endpoints — suggestions can only be created via the pipeline, rejection endpoint not yet exposed.
- Fixed similarity threshold — not configurable per workspace.
- `MatchSignalType.fromSchemaType` only maps EMAIL/PHONE directly; all other IDENTIFIER-classified schema types map to CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER.
