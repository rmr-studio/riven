# Domain: Workspaces & Users

---

## Overview

The Workspaces & Users domain is an **infrastructure-style foundational domain** that provides multi-tenancy, authentication, and authorization capabilities for the entire application. Unlike peer domains such as Workflows and Entities, this domain is the foundation they build upon — every domain in the system depends on Workspaces & Users for workspace scoping, user identity, and access control.

This domain manages the complete lifecycle of workspaces (multi-tenant containers), user profiles, workspace memberships with role-based permissions, and the authentication/authorization pipeline that enforces access control across all application operations.

## How Workspace Scoping Works

    J --> K[Filter by workspace_members<br/>WHERE user_id = auth.uid]
    K --> L[Return workspace-scoped data only]
```

## Boundaries

### This Domain Owns

- Workspace lifecycle (create, update, soft-delete)
- Workspace membership management (add, remove, role updates)
- Invitation workflow (create, accept, reject, revoke)
- User profile management (CRUD operations)
- JWT authentication and authority extraction (token decoding, claims parsing)
- Role-based authorization (@PreAuthorize expressions via WorkspaceSecurity)
- Row-level security activation via workspace_members table

### This Domain Does NOT Own

- Domain-specific business logic (Workflows, Entities, Blocks own their own logic)
- Database table-level RLS policy definitions (owned by database schema)
- External identity provider (Supabase Auth manages user creation and JWT signing)
- Workspace billing/payment processing (future domain)

## Sub-Domains

| Component | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| [[Workspace Management]] | Workspace CRUD, membership management, activity logging |
| [[Team Management]] | Invitation workflow, member onboarding (future: team features) |
| [[User Management]] | User profile CRUD, session-based user retrieval, default workspace |
| [[Auth & Authorization]] | JWT decoding, authority extraction, role-based access control, workspace security checks |

### Integrations

| Component | External System |
| --------- | --------------- |
| SecurityConfig | Supabase Auth (JWT signing/issuing) |

---

## Flows

| Flow        | Type                     | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| [[Auth & Authorization]] | User-facing | JWT decode -> authority extraction -> @PreAuthorize -> RLS (Phase 4) |
| [[Invitation Acceptance]] | User-facing | Create invite -> token -> accept -> add member (Phase 4) |

## Data

### Owned Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
| Workspace | Multi-tenant container | id, name, plan, defaultCurrency, memberCount, deleted |
| WorkspaceMember | User-workspace association with role | workspaceId, userId, role |
| WorkspaceInvite | Pending invitation | workspaceId, email, role, inviteStatus, token, invitedBy |
| User | Application user profile | id, name, email, phone, avatarUrl, defaultWorkspace |

### Database Tables

| Table | Entity | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| workspaces | Workspace | Multi-tenant container with plan/tier information |
| workspace_members | WorkspaceMember | Junction table for user-workspace associations with role, enables RLS |
| workspace_invites | WorkspaceInvite | Pending invitations with unique token and status |
| users | User | Application user profiles (created via Supabase Auth trigger) |

---

## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Failure Impact |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Supabase Auth | JWT signing and user identity management | No authentication possible — all requests rejected |
| PostgreSQL RLS | Row-level security for multi-tenant isolation | Data leakage across workspaces |

## Domain Interactions

### Depends On

| Domain | What We Consume | Via Component | Related Flow |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| (None — infrastructure domain) | — | — | — |

### Consumed By

| Consumer | What They Consume | Via Component | Related Flow |
|----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| [[Workflows]] | Workspace scoping (RLS), @PreAuthorize authorization | [[WorkspaceSecurity]], RLS via workspace_members | [[Auth & Authorization]], [[Queue Processing]] |
| [[Entities]] | Workspace scoping (RLS), @PreAuthorize authorization, user context | [[WorkspaceSecurity]], [[AuthTokenService]], RLS via workspace_members | [[Auth & Authorization]], [[Entity CRUD]] |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Summary |
| -------- | ------- |
| Infrastructure-style domain | Workspaces & Users is foundational — other domains depend on it for scoping and auth |
| JWT-based authentication | Supabase Auth signs JWTs, SecurityConfig validates and extracts authorities |
| ROLE_{workspaceId}_{role} authority format | Spring Security authorities encode workspace and role for @PreAuthorize checks |
| PostgreSQL RLS for workspace isolation | Database-level row filtering via workspace_members table ensures multi-tenant data security |
| Team Management as forward-looking subdomain | Current invitation/membership logic grouped under Team Management for future expansion |
