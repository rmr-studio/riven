# UserService

Part of [[User Management]]

## Purpose

Manages user profile CRUD with session-aware retrieval. Provides optimized workspace membership loading using JOIN queries to avoid N+1 problems.

---

## Responsibilities

- Session-based user retrieval (getUserFromSession)
- User retrieval with workspace memberships in single optimized query (getUserWithWorkspacesFromSession, getUserWithWorkspacesById)
- User profile updates with session ID validation (self-only)
- User deletion with cascading membership cleanup
- Default workspace assignment during profile updates

---

## Dependencies

- `UserRepository` — data access with custom findWorkspaceMembershipsByUserId query
- `WorkspaceRepository` — lookup for default workspace assignment
- [[AuthTokenService]] — get current user ID from JWT for session validation

## Used By

- `UserController` — REST API layer
- [[WorkspaceService]] — calls getUserWithWorkspacesFromSession during workspace creation for default workspace logic

---

## Key Logic

**getUserWithWorkspacesFromSession:**
- Extracts user ID from JWT via AuthTokenService
- Fetches UserEntity by ID
- Single optimized query via repository.findWorkspaceMembershipsByUserId — native query with JOIN to avoid N+1
- Maps projection results to WorkspaceMember models via toWorkspaceMember extension
- Returns User model with memberships populated
- Logs membership count at INFO level

**getUserWithWorkspacesById:**
- Same optimization strategy as getUserWithWorkspacesFromSession but accepts explicit userId parameter
- Used when caller needs another user's workspace memberships (not session user)

**updateUserDetails:**
- Validates session user ID matches target user.id (throws AccessDeniedException if mismatch) — self-only enforcement
- Updates name, email, phone, avatarUrl fields
- Default workspace update: if user.defaultWorkspace.id provided, looks up WorkspaceEntity via WorkspaceRepository
- Saves updated UserEntity
- Returns updated User model
- Info logging of update

**deleteUserProfile:**
- @Transactional annotation ensures atomic deletion
- Validates user exists via findOrThrow before deletion
- Deletes user record by ID — cascade to WorkspaceMemberEntity handled by database FK constraints
- Info logging of deletion

---

## Public Methods

### `getUserFromSession(): UserEntity`

Retrieves UserEntity for authenticated session user. No workspace memberships loaded.

### `getUserWithWorkspacesFromSession(): User`

Retrieves session user with all workspace memberships in single query. Optimized for profile pages.

### `getUserWithWorkspacesById(userId): User`

Retrieves specified user with all workspace memberships in single query. Optimized batch loading.

### `getUserById(id): UserEntity`

Retrieves UserEntity by ID. No workspace memberships loaded.

### `updateUserDetails(user): User`

Updates session user's profile. Validates session match. Updates name, email, phone, avatarUrl, defaultWorkspace.

### `deleteUserProfile(userId)`

Transactional deletion of user and associated membership records.

## Gotchas

- **Double self-only enforcement:** updateUserDetails checks session ID match at service level, AND UserController likely has similar check at controller level — belt and suspenders approach
- **N+1 optimization:** getUserWithWorkspaces* methods use custom repository query with JOIN to fetch all memberships in one query — critical for performance when user has many workspaces
- **Projection mapping:** findWorkspaceMembershipsByUserId returns custom projection interface, requires toWorkspaceMember extension function to convert to model — indirection in mapping layer
- **Default workspace FK:** updateUserDetails looks up workspace via WorkspaceRepository to ensure FK integrity — will throw if workspace ID is invalid
- **Cascade deletion:** deleteUserProfile relies on database FK cascade to remove WorkspaceMemberEntity records — no explicit service-level cascade logic
