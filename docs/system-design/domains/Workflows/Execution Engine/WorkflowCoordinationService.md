# WorkflowCoordinationService

Part of [[Execution Engine]]

## Purpose

Temporal activity bridge between the deterministic workflow orchestrator and Spring-managed services, coordinating individual workflow node execution by delegating to [[WorkflowGraphCoordinationService]] for DAG orchestration.

---

## Responsibilities

- Fetch workflow nodes and edges from database (allowed in activities, not workflows)
- Create `WorkflowDataStore` with execution metadata and initial state
- Provide `NodeServiceProvider` callback for on-demand Spring service access during node execution
- Execute batch of ready nodes via callback passed to graph coordinator
- Resolve node input templates against `WorkflowDataStore` via [[WorkflowNodeInputResolverService]]
- Execute nodes polymorphically via `node.execute(store, inputs, services)`
- Persist node execution records to `workflow_execution_node` table
- Classify and throw `ApplicationFailure` for Temporal retry handling
- Update execution records with success/failure status and structured error details

---

## Dependencies

- [[WorkflowGraphCoordinationService]] — DAG orchestration and batch scheduling
- [[WorkflowNodeInputResolverService]] — Template resolution
- [[WorkflowErrorClassifier]] — Exception classification for retry behavior
- `WorkflowExecutionNodeRepository` — Persistence for node execution state
- `NodeServiceProvider` — On-demand service injection for nodes

## Used By

- [[WorkflowOrchestrationService]] — Invokes as Temporal activity for node coordination

---

## Key Logic

**Execution flow:**

1. Fetch nodes and edges from database (activity context allows DB access)
2. Create `WorkflowDataStore` with metadata from Temporal activity context
3. Define `nodeExecutor` callback that resolves inputs and executes nodes
4. Delegate to `WorkflowGraphCoordinationService.executeWorkflow()` with callback
5. Coordinator calls back with ready node batches
6. For each node: resolve inputs, execute polymorphically, capture output, persist state

**Error classification:**

Uses [[WorkflowErrorClassifier]] to categorize exceptions:
- HTTP 4xx → `HTTP_CLIENT_ERROR` (non-retryable)
- HTTP 5xx → `HTTP_SERVER_ERROR` (retryable)
- CONTROL_FLOW nodes → `CONTROL_FLOW_ERROR` (deterministic, non-retryable)
- Validation errors → `VALIDATION_ERROR` (non-retryable)
- All others → `EXECUTION_ERROR` (retryable, transient assumption)

Throws `ApplicationFailure` with error type for Temporal's retry policy matching.

## Public Methods

### `executeWorkflowWithCoordinator(workflowDefinitionId, nodeIds, workspaceId): WorkflowDataStore`

Executes workflow DAG by coordinating with graph coordinator. Fetches nodes/edges, creates datastore, defines executor callback, delegates orchestration. Returns final datastore with all step outputs.

---

## Gotchas

- **Spring bean in Temporal activity:** Temporal's Spring Boot starter auto-registers this as an activity. The interface `WorkflowCoordination` has the `@ActivityInterface` annotation, not this implementation.
- **Sequential batch execution:** Nodes in the same batch currently execute sequentially (not truly parallel). TODO at line 115 indicates future parallel execution via Temporal child workflows.
- **Single execution record per node:** Creates `WorkflowExecutionNodeEntity` BEFORE try block and reuses it in both success and error paths to prevent duplicate records during retries.
- **Polymorphic dispatch:** No type switching on node type. Each `WorkflowNode` implementation provides its own `execute()` method, enabling extensibility.
