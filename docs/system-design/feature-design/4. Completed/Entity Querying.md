# Quick Design: Entity Querying

## What & Why

A centralised platform to query entities based on
- Entity Type
- Specific Entity Conditions (Ie. *status == xx* and *arr >= yy*)
- Specific Entity Relationships (Ie. *entity.xx is linked to yy*)
- Specific Relationship Conditions (Ie. *entity.yy has zz where zz.xx == dd*)
The data models and service functionality should then be commonly accessed and used throughout every other feature that requires specific entity querying
	- Reporting
	- Workflows
	- Other external integration capabilities

## Data Changes

**New/Modified Entities:**
- *Modified* WorkflowEntityQueryConfig - Move Query Structure out into a commonly accessed model
- *EntityQueryService* - Service development to take in defined query from external sources and fetches all related entities (Paginated based)

**New/Modified Fields:**
