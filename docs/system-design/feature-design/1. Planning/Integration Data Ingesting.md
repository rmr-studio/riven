# Feature: Integration Data Ingesting

---
## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
- Third party integrations are a core fundamental area that is linked to the success of the platform.
	- The platform is centred around the cross domain intelligence capabilities by tying together an organisations third party tooling into a singular data source. So it is important that data is continuously synced and accessible.
### Proposed Solution
- An integration framework would need to be created as a common layer that is used to support the integration of a wide-variety of third party toolings
- This should provide the ability to manage
	- Storing and retrieving API keys to send requests to their API
		- Encryption and secrets rotation for additional security
	- Defining Preset Entity Types for all data sources ingested from the third party integrations
		- Adding the capability for meaningful relationships to be added between this data, and other data sources within the existing entity environment
		- Ensuring that the data model stays consistent, and crucial attributes and relationships are protected
	- Introducing the ability to form links back to existing data sources through common attributes
		- For example, An integration with a Support tool would need to ensure that every support ticket is recorded, is able to be linked to an existing customer that is defined within a seperate data model, outside of the entity types provided by the integration. This may be through username, email, etc
	- Handling webhooks for real time data ingest, and ensuring it fits within the provided entity environment
		- Fallback to scheduled polling if external API's do not support webhooks
	

### Success Criteria

_How do we know this feature is working correctly?_

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## 2. Data Model

### New Entities

_What new tables/entities are being introduced?_

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|        |         |            |

### Entity Modifications

_What existing entities need changes?_

|Entity|Change|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Data Ownership

_Which component is the source of truth for each piece of data?_

### Relationships

```
[Entity A] ---(relationship)---> [Entity B]
```

### Data Lifecycle

- **Creation:** How/when is this data created?
- **Updates:** What triggers changes?
- **Deletion:** When/how is it removed? Soft delete? Cascade?

### Consistency Requirements

- [ ] Requires strong consistency (ACID transactions)
- [ ] Eventual consistency acceptable
- _If eventual:_ What's the acceptable delay? What happens during inconsistency?
