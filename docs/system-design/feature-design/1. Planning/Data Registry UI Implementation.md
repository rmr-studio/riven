# Quick Design: Data Registry UI Implementation

## What & Why

When a user is a building a workflow. It is critical that they are able to use the executed results from previous nodes when performing actions.
- Such as querying a set of entities, and for each entity performing an action, where the action takes in a single entity

Currently the Workflow UI is not aware of the data registry, and would not be aware of the results a node would produce, and how another node could access this.

[[Workflow Node Output State Management Handling]] should add the functionality that exposes both
	- The type of data that a node should produce (ie. Entity[])
	- The data that is produced to the registry, and the link to reference it.
When creating new nodes and adjusting a nodes input configuration. A user should then have access to a UI component that maps all data from the registry to a node, where each node has a unique identifier (A user could rename each node)
Each output to the data registry could be Labelled
	- Ie. A node (`Create new Lead`) could produce a new entity, the payload of that new entity would be recorded in the data registry as `lead`
	- The UI could then access this in other nodes using `Create New Lead`.`Lead`
