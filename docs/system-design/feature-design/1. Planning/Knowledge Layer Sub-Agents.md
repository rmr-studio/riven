# Feature: Knowledge Layer Sub-agents

---
## 1. Overview
### Problem Statement
- While the overarching knowledge layer, accessible through [[Prompt Construction for Knowledge Model Queries]] would grant users with the ability to possess cross-domain intelligence in order to answer their questions on demand, there needs to also be a more proactive approach to how data and knowledge is surfaced and observed, the platform also needs to feel like its alive, through the use of `agentic` capabilities 

### Proposed Solution

- A workspace can then also define `perspectives` 
	- These act as individual 'agents', with stored instructions, a defined scope of entities and relationships and a trigger (ie. Entity data change, scheduled cron job, threshold met)
		- *Track which segments churn fastest and why*
		- *Monitor customer acquisition efficiency across channels*
		- *Monitor churn rate by acquisition channel*
		- *Flag when support ticket volume spikes for a customer segment*
		- *Watch for customers who go inactive for more than 14 days after their first purchase*
		- *Monitor product-revenue patterns*
		- *Tracking support to churn correlations*
- These workers would then be further extends upon by [[Extrapolate Agentic Perspectives from Entity Schema]]
- These agents are provided set analytical briefs that ask a singular question or ask for the observation of a particular area of relationship between domains. These are then triggered via a schedule or data event, the output of this may include
	- A daily overview that is updated per day
	- A report sent to the workspace's notifications
- A Temporal workflow will be set up that would handle the actions performed by a sub-agent perspective

```
AnalyticalBriefWorkflow
├── Activity: ParseBriefAndDetermineScope
│   └── Extract entity types, relationships, metadata filters from the stored brief
├── Activity: RetrieveRelevantVectors
│   └── pgvector similarity search with metadata filtering
├── Activity: ConstructPromptWithSchemaContext
│   └── Build the full prompt with retrieved data + schema definitions
├── Activity: CallReasoningLLM
│   └── Send to OpenAI/Anthropic, get response
└── Activity: DeliverInsight
    └── Store result, trigger notification, update dashboard — whatever the output
```

- These sub-agents should then be able to interact with [[Workflows]]
	- A sub-agent could be given certain conditions, where if they are met, a specific automation is triggered, with the relevant data being passed through a function input, for example:
		- *an agent detects that customers from a specific acquisition channel are churning at an elevated rate*
			- **it triggers an automation that tags those customers and notifies the relevant team member**
### Success Criteria

_How do we know this feature is working correctly?_

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## 2. Data Model

### New Entities

_What new tables/entities are being introduced?_

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|        |         |            |

### Entity Modifications

_What existing entities need changes?_

|Entity|Change|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Data Ownership

_Which component is the source of truth for each piece of data?_

### Relationships

```
[Entity A] ---(relationship)---> [Entity B]
```

### Data Lifecycle

- **Creation:** How/when is this data created?
- **Updates:** What triggers changes?
- **Deletion:** When/how is it removed? Soft delete? Cascade?

### Consistency Requirements

- [ ] Requires strong consistency (ACID transactions)
- [ ] Eventual consistency acceptable
- _If eventual:_ What's the acceptable delay? What happens during inconsistency?
