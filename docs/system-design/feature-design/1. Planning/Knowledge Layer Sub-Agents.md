# Feature: Knowledge Layer Sub-agents

---
## 1. Overview
### Problem Statement
- While the overarching knowledge layer, accessible through [[riven/docs/system-design/feature-design/1. Planning/Prompt Construction for Knowledge Model Queries]] would grant users with the ability to possess cross-domain intelligence in order to answer their questions on demand, there needs to also be a more proactive approach to how data and knowledge is surfaced and observed, the platform also needs to feel like its alive, through the use of `agentic` capabilities 

### Proposed Solution

- A workspace can then also define `perspectives` 
	- These act as individual 'agents', with stored instructions, a defined scope of entities and relationships and a trigger (ie. Entity data change, scheduled cron job, threshold met)
		- *Track which segments churn fastest and why*
		- *Monitor customer acquisition efficiency across channels*
		- *Monitor churn rate by acquisition channel*
		- *Flag when support ticket volume spikes for a customer segment*
		- *Watch for customers who go inactive for more than 14 days after their first purchase*
		- *Monitor product-revenue patterns*
		- *Tracking support to churn correlations*
- These workers would then be further extends upon by [[riven/docs/system-design/feature-design/1. Planning/Extrapolate Agentic Perspectives from Entity Schema]]
- These agents are provided set analytical briefs that ask a singular question or ask for the observation of a particular area of relationship between domains. These are then triggered via a schedule or data event, the output of this may include
	- A daily overview that is updated per day
	- A report sent to the workspace's notifications
- A Temporal workflow will be set up that would handle the actions performed by a sub-agent perspective

```
AnalyticalBriefWorkflow
├── Activity: ParseBriefAndDetermineScope
│   └── Extract entity types, relationships, metadata filters from the stored brief
├── Activity: RetrieveRelevantVectors
│   └── pgvector similarity search with metadata filtering
├── Activity: ConstructPromptWithSchemaContext
│   └── Build the full prompt with retrieved data + schema definitions
├── Activity: CallReasoningLLM
│   └── Send to OpenAI/Anthropic, get response
└── Activity: DeliverInsight
    └── Store result, trigger notification, update dashboard — whatever the output
```

- These sub-agents should then be able to interact with [[riven/docs/system-design/domains/Workflows/Workflows]]
	- A sub-agent could be given certain conditions, where if they are met, a specific automation is triggered, with the relevant data being passed through a function input, for example:
		- *an agent detects that customers from a specific acquisition channel are churning at an elevated rate*
			- **it triggers an automation that tags those customers and notifies the relevant team member**
#### Pre-wired Lifecycle Perspectives

Per CEO Plan: Lifecycle Vertical Scoping (2026-03-18), sub-agents ship with pre-configured lifecycle perspectives out of the box. These activate as data flows into each lifecycle domain — they are not blank agents users must configure.

**Proposed initial perspectives:**

| Perspective | Lifecycle Domain(s) | What It Watches | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Channel Quality Monitor | ACQUISITION → RETENTION | Divergence between channel conversion rate and downstream retention | Weekly schedule + data change |
| Onboarding Health Tracker | ONBOARDING | First-30-day support load vs. cohort norms, setup completion rates | Daily schedule |
| Usage Engagement Monitor | USAGE | Feature adoption trends, usage drop-offs, inactive customer detection | Daily schedule + usage event |
| Support Load Analyzer | SUPPORT → BILLING | Support ticket volume correlation with customer value and churn risk | Data change (new ticket) |
| Churn Signal Detector | Cross-domain | Correlates usage drops + support spikes + billing patterns into churn risk scores | Daily schedule |
| Revenue Cohort Analyzer | BILLING → ACQUISITION | Revenue and expansion trends by acquisition cohort | Weekly schedule |

Perspectives are defined as manifest entries alongside the lifecycle spine templates. Users can modify, disable, or create their own.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Sub-agent perspectives can be defined, scoped to entity types/relationships, and triggered via schedule or data change
- [ ] Pre-wired lifecycle perspectives activate automatically as data flows into their scoped lifecycle domains
- [ ] Perspective output is structured (not free-text) and can be surfaced on the Lifecycle Operations Dashboard
- [ ] Perspectives degrade gracefully with partial data — explain what's missing rather than failing silently
- [ ] Users can modify, disable, or create custom perspectives
- [ ] Perspective execution handles LLM failures (timeout, malformed response, refusal) with distinct rescue strategies
- [ ] Perspective definitions are manifest-based — community-contributable

## 2. Data Model

### New Entities

_What new tables/entities are being introduced?_

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|        |         |            |

### Entity Modifications

_What existing entities need changes?_

|Entity|Change|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Data Ownership

_Which component is the source of truth for each piece of data?_

### Relationships

```
[Entity A] ---(relationship)---> [Entity B]
```

### Data Lifecycle

- **Creation:** How/when is this data created?
- **Updates:** What triggers changes?
- **Deletion:** When/how is it removed? Soft delete? Cascade?

### Consistency Requirements

- [ ] Requires strong consistency (ACID transactions)
- [ ] Eventual consistency acceptable
- _If eventual:_ What's the acceptable delay? What happens during inconsistency?
