# Feature: Semantic Metadata Baked Entity Data Model Templates

---

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement

A user that creates a new environment without any prior structure will waste hours creating their own data models, with additional complexity, incorrect semantic definitions and time wasted, this will cause nothing but frustration and will most likely result in users churning before they ever get to the features.
There needs to be a way to get a user set up with an example template, that matches the outcome they need, with the ability to then make additional tweaks to fit their use case exactly
### Proposed Solution

```
Your template semantic definitions feed directly into this. When a template defines that an entity type "Customer" with field "source" means acquisition channel, that semantic mapping is what tells the embedding pipeline how to enrich the context. Without it, you're just embedding raw field values with no meaning.
```

- Templates are provided that provide ready to go definitions for all entity types, attributes and interconnecting relationships. All of these include complete semantic metadata
	- SaaS Startup (customers, subscriptions, MRR, churn, support interactions, feature usage)
	- DTC E-commerce (customers, orders, products, acquisition channels, support, returns)
	- Service Business (clients, projects, invoices, communications, deliverables)
- Templates include 3-5 pre-configured analytical briefs that demonstrate cross-domain querying
- Templates include example queries that work well even with minimal data (scoped narrowly enough to be useful with <50 records)
### Success Criteria

_How do we know this feature is working correctly?_

- [ ] A user is able to pre-configure an entire ready to go entity ecosystem within 10 minutes of setup
- [ ] A user is able to modify the template and the [[Semantically Imbued Entity Attributes]] without breaking existing embeddings
- [ ] Templates contain pre-configured [[Sub-Agents (Proactive Intelligence)]] that are able to produce useful insights once the ecosystem begins to become populated with meaningful data

## 2. Data Model

### New Entities

_What new tables/entities are being introduced?_

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|        |         |            |

### Entity Modifications

_What existing entities need changes?_

|Entity|Change|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Data Ownership

_Which component is the source of truth for each piece of data?_

### Relationships

```
[Entity A] ---(relationship)---> [Entity B]
```

### Data Lifecycle

- **Creation:** How/when is this data created?
- **Updates:** What triggers changes?
- **Deletion:** When/how is it removed? Soft delete? Cascade?

### Consistency Requirements

- [ ] Requires strong consistency (ACID transactions)
- [ ] Eventual consistency acceptable
- _If eventual:_ What's the acceptable delay? What happens during inconsistency?

## 3. Component Design

### New Components

_List each new service/component this feature introduces_

#### ComponentName

- **Responsibility:**
- **Dependencies:** [[Dependency1]], [[Dependency2]]
- **Exposes to:** [[Consumer1]], [[Consumer2]]

### Affected Existing Components

|Component|Change Required|Impact|
|---|---|---|
|[[]]|||

### Component Interaction Diagram

```mermaid

    participant A as ComponentA
    participant B as ComponentB
    participant C as ComponentC
    
    A->>B: 
    B->>C: 
    C-->>B: 
    B-->>A: 
```

## 4. API Design

### New Endpoints

#### `POST /api/v1/resource`

- **Purpose:**
- **Request:**

```json
{
  
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  
}
```

- **Error Cases:**
    - `400` -
    - `404` -
    - `409` -

### Contract Changes

_Any changes to existing APIs? Versioning implications?_

### Idempotency

- [ ] Operations are idempotent
- _If not:_ How do we handle retries?

- **Query patterns:**
- **Potential N+1 issues:**

---

## 8. Observability

### Key Metrics

_What metrics indicate this feature is healthy?_

|Metric|Normal Range|Alert Threshold|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Logging

_What events should be logged? At what level?_

|Event|Level|Key Fields|
|---|---|---|
||INFO/WARN/ERROR||
