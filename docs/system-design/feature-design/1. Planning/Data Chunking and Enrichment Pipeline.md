# Feature: Data Enrichment Pipeline

---
## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
To build the RAG model for data acquisition, raw data coming from important environment events
	- Entity insertions, updates and deletions
	- Integration Events
will need to be consumed, processed and analysed, not just in its raw form, but in context to its overarching schema, and what the semantics behind this event mean for data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities.

Data needs to be processed into embeddable chunks, enriched with schema context converted to embeddings and stored via `pgvector` 
### Proposed Solution
> `The first is metadata-enriched embeddings, where before embedding a piece of data, you prepend or append its schema context. So instead of embedding "I'm frustrated with the onboarding flow," you embed something like "Support communication from customer segment: Enterprise, acquisition channel: Paid Search, subscription tier: Pro, churn risk: unknown — message content: I'm frustrated with the onboarding flow." The embedding now captures both the semantic content and the structural position in your entity graph.`

- A postgres based job queue will be developed to handle all data sources that need to be processed through a pipeline
	- Each job represents an entity based event that occurs for any given workspace
		- The job would contain the set of ids affected and the action (ie. CREATE,UPDATE,DELETE)
- An asynchronous Temporal based workflow execution will be set up to then continuously consume all jobs that appear in the queue
- The triggers to start the pipeline include
	- Entity created
	- Entity updated (attributes or relationships changed)
	- Related entity updated (if relationship is semantically significant)
	- Schema change affecting entity type [[Schema Change Handling]]
	- Integration sync completes for entity
	- Manual re-embedding requested

├── Activity: ConstructEnrichedText
│   ├── Apply semantic descriptions to structure the text
│   ├── Include relevant attribute values with semantic labels
│   ├── Include relationship context with related entity summaries
│   └── Prepend entity type category and workspace context
├── Activity: GenerateEmbedding

│   ├── Retry with exponential backoff on failure
│   └── Return vector
├── Activity: StoreEmbeddingWithMetadata
│   ├── Store vector in pgvector column
│   ├── Store metadata for filtering (entity_type, workspace_id, semantic_category, related_entity_types, timestamps)
│   └── Update entity record with embedding_updated_at timestamp
└── Compensation: Log failure, mark entity as embedding_pending for retry queue
```
### Success Criteria

- Embedding latency p95 < 5 seconds from entity mutation to stored vector 
- Pipeline handles 1000 entity mutations per hour without backlog growth 
- Failed embeddings are automatically retried with visibility into failure reasons 
- Embeddings are never retrieved across workspace boundaries
