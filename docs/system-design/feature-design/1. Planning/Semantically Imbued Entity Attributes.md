# Feature: Semantically Imbued Entity Attributes

---
## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
- One of the core fundamentals of the knowledge layer. Is that the AI is able to understand the business logic, and underlying patterns found within the data because of the surrounding semantics.
- It is crucial that during data ingestion, the process is able to support background metadata that explains the reasoning and patterns behind new data

### Proposed Solution
```
The first is metadata-enriched embeddings, where before embedding a piece of data, you prepend or append its schema context. So instead of embedding "I'm frustrated with the onboarding flow," you embed something like "Support communication from customer segment: Enterprise, acquisition channel: Paid Search, subscription tier: Pro, churn risk: unknown — message content: I'm frustrated with the onboarding flow." The embedding now captures both the semantic content and the structural position in your entity graph.
```

- Two new data models are added to the database
	- `entity_type_semantic_metadata`
		  For each entity type, referenced by its ID. It should store a semantic description and semantic category
			  - Person
			  - Organisation
			  - Transaction
			  - Communication
			  - Product
			  - Event
			  - Document
			  - Custom
			  - ...more
	- As all attributes and relationships are stored within an entity, meaningful JSON querying will be hard, so attributes and relationships will also share another data model 
		- `entity_semantic_metadata`
		- ```
		  entity_id (fk U)
		  schema_id (fk U)
		  type (attribute, relationship)
		  semantic_description
		  semantic_type (Attribute Type OR Relationship Nature)
		  ```
	- The attribute semantic type should describe its type, and not purpose
		- Identifier
		- Categorical
		- Quantitative
		- Temporal
	- The relationship type should describe what the relationship means
		- Ownership
		- Transaction
		- Communication
		- Hierqarchy
		- Association
		- Temporal
### Success Criteria

_How do we know this feature is working correctly?_

- [ ] Every entity type, attribute and relationship has attached semantic metadata
- [ ] The flow to add semantic metadata is incorporated inside the UI upon entity modelling, is mandatory, but does not hinder UX

## 2. Data Model

### New Entities

_What new tables/entities are being introduced?_

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|        |         |            |

### Entity Modifications

_What existing entities need changes?_

|Entity|Change|Rationale|
|---|---|---|
||||

### Data Ownership

_Which component is the source of truth for each piece of data?_

### Relationships

```
[Entity A] ---(relationship)---> [Entity B]
```

### Data Lifecycle

- **Creation:** How/when is this data created?
- **Updates:** What triggers changes?
- **Deletion:** When/how is it removed? Soft delete? Cascade?

### Consistency Requirements

- [ ] Requires strong consistency (ACID transactions)
- [ ] Eventual consistency acceptable
- _If eventual:_ What's the acceptable delay? What happens during inconsistency?
